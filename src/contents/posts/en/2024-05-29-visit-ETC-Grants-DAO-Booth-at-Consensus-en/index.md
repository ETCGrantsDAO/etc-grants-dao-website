The ETC Grants DAO team will be at Consensus, booth #915! We invite all ETC enthusiasts to drop by and connect. Whether you're interested in ETC's technical details or its application prospects, our team will be there to answer your questions and share the latest project updates.

If that wasn't reason enough, our beloved limited edition ETC panda T-shirt will also make an appearance at the Consensus! The panda shirt garnered a lot of attention at Bitcoin Asia. If you missed out last time make sure to drop by the booth early. Supplies are limited.  

Additionally, @ETCGrantsDAO https://x.com/ETCGrantsDao will provide a discount code for Consensus tickets to attendees! Direct message us for the code. We will also host a celebration event during Consensus to mark the ETC reduction - stay tuned!

With such a vibrant array of activities and surprises, why wait? Come to Consensus and witness the bright future of ETC with the ETC Grants DAO team! 

ETC Grants DAO Booth #915.

We look forward to your visit!
