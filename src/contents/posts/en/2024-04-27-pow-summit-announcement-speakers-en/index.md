Join Us at the second annual [Proof-of-Work Summit](https://powsummit.com/) in September in Frankfurt, Germany. 

The ETC Cooperative is thrilled to continue our partnership with the Litecoin Foundation to bring you the second annual Proof-of-Work Summit. This landmark conference will take place in Frankfurt, Germany, from September 27-29, 2024, and will celebrate the world’s most effective and secure consensus mechanism.

Hosting the second Proof-of-Work (POW) Summit in a city renowned for its technological and financial heritage, like Frankfurt, was an obvious choice.  The city provides an excellent environment for exploring the future of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies.

The POW Summit seeks to revive and embody the spirit and principles of cypherpunks, the pioneers of the blockchain revolution. In this spirit, the Summit gathers leading experts to discuss a wide range of topics. Speakers include:

* JAMESON LOPP - Professional Cypherpunk, www.lopp.net
* CHARLIE LEE - Founder, Litecoin
* DANIEL BATTEN - ClimateTech Investor
* SERGIO LERNER - Chief of Innovation, RootstockLabs
* PHIL ZIMMERMANN - Creator, Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
* DENNIS PORTER - CEO and Co-Founder, Satoshi Action Fund

Additional speakers will be announced soon.

The “Bitcoin Renaissance” AKA “Bitcoin Season 2” has been underway for the last year or so and is an exhilarating validation of Bitcoin and POW in general for a broad set of use cases that have historically only happened on other chains. POW Summit 2024 will explain the cypherpunk fundamentals and value proposition of the major POW chains across the following thematic streams:

* Proof of Scale (Bitcoin L2s and Sidechains) - This track will focus on presenting technical and economic tradeoffs from the leading L2 and sidechain projects.
* Proof of Utility (Emerging Protocols and Utilities) - This track will focus on emerging Protocols and Utilities competing for scarce block space on the base layer, and L2’s.
* Proof of Sustainability (Mining and Environment) - This track will focus on how and why the POW chains are the most ecological and efficient thermodynamic method for creating and securing maps of data in space and time.
* Proof of Human Rights (Privacy, Fungibility, Legal Issues) - This track will feature anything from cutting-edge technology, to commentary and future visions.

The conference will feature a variety of, panel discussions, and networking opportunities, giving attendees the chance to connect with blockchain enthusiasts and experts. There will be ample time for networking, idea exchange, and exploring new opportunities.
