We are happy to release the ETC Cooperative's Goals and Budget for 2024, and the Annual General Meeting (AGM) resolutions.

* [ETC Cooperative's AGM Resolutions](/etc-coop-resolutions-2024.pdf)

2023 was a year of stability for the ETC Cooperative, with a strong financial position and a fully-staffed team.  This was in stark contrast to previous years, where we had minimal staff beyond the Executive Director and had weak communications and marketing.

Donald produced a huge number of articles, both to the community website and for the Cooperative’s own site which was completely revamped.  All our communications are simultaneously released in English and Chinese.

We launched the ETC Grants DAO program, organized the inaugural POW Summit, and coordinated the Spiral hardfork (which activated in February 2024).  Our developers continue to maintain and upgrade the core-geth client as our key development project, together with various other lower priority projects.

Our goals for 2024 are similar to 2023. We are in a steady state and do not have any urgent issues to address or crises to avert. There will be another round of grants and another POW Summit event, and we will be working with Bitmain on other initiatives to grow the ETC ecosystem.

## Grants Program

The ETC Grants DAO program was launched in January 2023, during the first round of the program around $700K USD worth of ETC was allocated to seventeen development teams. The program will continue with a second round of open application grants in the course of 2024. Bitmain continues to be very supportive of Ethereum Classic, and it is likely that the open grants program will be augmented with direct grants and partnerships with Bitmain to maximize the value delivered with these funds.

## POW Summit 2024

The inaugural POW Summit was held in Prague in late September 2023.  This was co-hosted with Litecoin Foundation, and was organized to be back-to-back with Hackers Congress Paralelní Polis (HCPP).  This was the ETC Cooperative’s first conference since October 2019. In 2024, the second POW Summit will be held, details of which will be announced soon. 

## Development: Enhancing Client Stability and Functionality

The ETC Cooperative’s proposed pathway for ETC for 2024 development is:

- Enhancing client stability and functionality through comprehensive maintenance and enhancement of the Core-Geth client, and advanced support and refinement in cross-client testing (e.g. Core Geth, Erigon, Core Geth Light, Hyperledger Besu).
- Network observation and analysis advancements (network health) tools such as node infrastructure for observation and analysis; upgrading chain and network monitoring and incident reaction systems; upgrading network analysis tooling; and unified infrastructure management (many servers are managed manually, so we will unify adminstration with a single deployment interface called Ansible).
- Technological development and exploration where we will explore EVM Object Format (EOF), continue advocacy for inclusion to Ethereum and ETC (the Prague hardfork in Ethereum will potentially include EOF but it is competing with Verkle trees); exploring EIP-1559 enablement for Ethereum compatibility; for Verkle Trees we will research ETC implications in the absence of a beacon chain (the Ethereum Patricia Merkle Tree will be replaced with the new lighter Verkle Tree model); we will study privacy-oriented Core-Geth deployment, perhaps add privacy technology to node software such as VPN; and enhancing regression testing and automating release processes (whether new releases affect older releases, etc.).

## Communications and Marketing

The purpose of the ETC Cooperative communications team is to support and promote Ethereum Classic and to keep the ecosystem and the world informed about the ETC Cooperative's projects, finances, and governance. For 2024 we plan to keep increasing ETC's usership and hashrate. For this, we will continue with our marketing, editorial, and social media efforts. We will focus on increasing brand awareness and user acquisition; community engagement; educational Initiatives; partnerships and collaborations; deepening exchange collaborations for network security; and media coverage. 

## Corporate Changes

In 2023, the ETC Cooperative was recommended by their tax advisors to review the classification of all staff members (whether as contractors or employees). This review was undertaken by outside legal counsel, looking at the ramifications for both the ETC Cooperative as a US non-profit entity and for the staff members themselves. 
It was determined that all United States residents should be classified as employees rather than contractors.  This process was initiated in 2023 and continues in 2024. It was also determined that there was tax assessment risk from a Canadian standpoint, so Bob Summerwill and Alison Alexis changed status via an employer of record.

With regard to the non-profit status, during the 2023 calendar year we began the process of converting the ETC Cooperative from a public charity into a private operating foundation or a private foundation, due to the lack of diversity of funding sources, which is required to maintain 501(c)3 status. This is called the public support test. The test states that at least 1/3 (33.3%) of donations must be given by donors who give less than 2% of the nonprofit’s overall receipts. We will be working with our tax advisors to flesh out the requirements for the transition and what effect that will have on the Coop. However, it does not appear that these requirements will result in many operational changes if the status of a private operating foundation can be achieved.
