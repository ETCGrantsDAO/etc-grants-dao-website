# EGD Grants Process {.parent-scroll-element #grantsProcess}

![Grant Workflow](grants-workflow-en.jpg)

Here is an in-depth description of the 7 step grant process:

### Step 1: Call for Proposals { .scroll-element #grantsProcess.phases.step1}

At the beginning of each grant round, the EGD grant committee will formally open the round with a call for proposals. The documentation on the grant site and other marketing materials , will outline the exact timeline for each grant round, for the following phases:

- • The application submission (generally 3 months, subject to change)
- • The EGD grant committee review and approval (generally one month, subject to change)
- • Announcing the recipients and disbursing the funds.

### Step 2: Grant Application Submission { .scroll-element #grantsProcess.phases.step2}

Applications to be submitted via an Airtable form the application page. Click on the “Apply now” button to access the form.

The application will outline all relevant details of the project and the team. People should enter as much information as possible about their project, providing clear milestones and deliverables.

When applying, you will choose one of four grant types: Community, Conversion, Standard and Premium.  You will need to ensure that your requested grant funding does not exceed the guidelines for the grant type. To receive a premium grant, a team will be expected to have a clear financial breakdown, a proven track record of success, and clearly demonstrate the value proposition to the grants committee.

All projects must use permissive open-source licenses, with only the following licenses being acceptable:

- • [Apache 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License) - good for source code
- • [Mozilla MPL 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Public_License) - good for source code (Javascript friendly)
- • [Creative Commons (CC-BY-SA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license) - good for documentation

Weaker licenses like MIT and BSD provide no protection against submarine patents and stronger copyleft licenses like GPLv3 constrain the use of the code in ways that reduce the value we are delivering. Funding will not be provided for projects seeking to build proprietary solutions. The copyright for these projects will remain with the authors, but licensing must be permissive and patents must not be filed on the outputs of these projects.

We will not be considering applications seeking to retroactively claim funding for previously completed projects or to compensate individuals for prior work. This program is intended to spur new development, whether from new entrants or existing ecosystem participants.

### Step 3: Evaluation/Technical review { .scroll-element #grantsProcess.phases.step3}

Decisions on the initial round of grants will be made by a committee appointed by BITMAIN, ANTPOOL, and the ETC Cooperative, as the initial donors in this grants process. If further donors join the process, they will be invited to participate in the decision-making process as well.

There is no specific plan to open up the decision-making progress to the broader ETC community at the time of writing. Longer term the committee may consider moving, step-by-step, towards an open DAO structure where all ETC token holders have the option to participate in the decision-making process.

Voting will be recorded using Snapshot (see etcgrantsdao.eth), in a similar manner to the existing Snapshot instance used for Litecoin/Antpool voting.

During the evaluation and technical review the grant committee will look at all the information submitted by each team and evaluate the application. Please note that the voting for the projects will be done by the members listed above, but the technical evaluation of the projects will be done by a broader set of individuals, including the ETC core developers. This is to ensure that there is a sufficient technical review of all applications.

Reasons a project may be declined:

- • The project is not aligned with ETC’s values.
- • The project doesn’t have a way to sustain itself after grant funding has been fully utilized (if it is not an open-source public good type grant).
- • The project team does not appear to have the requisite expertise to accomplish project goals.
- • The cost/benefit of the project is insufficient.

Your project will have better chances for acceptance if the following are met:

- • Your team has proven experience and strong technical background.
- • Your team can demonstrate that they have a business model that will sustain the project long-term. If the project is an open-source public good and thus there are no financial incentives for the team or to sustain the project, the application should be clear on how much annual funding would be required to maintain the project. Funding beyond the initial grant is not guaranteed and the team would have to apply for grants in subsequent periods.
- • The application clearly presents milestones and how to evaluate whether KPIs have been met or not.
- • The project fills an obvious void in the current ecosystem.
- • The project provides clear value to the ETC ecosystem.

During this phase, the grant committee team may reach out for more information regarding your project and conduct an interview. If your project is already in a testing phase, we may schedule a time to demonstrate the project and for the committee members and other involved stakeholders to review and ask questions.

As the grant program matures more feedback will be provided on what quantitative and qualitative factors grants will be evaluated against.

### Step 4: Grants team approval { .scroll-element #grantsProcess.phases.step4}

After evaluating all submitted grants. the applicants will be notified whether their application has been accepted or denied.  If an application was denied, the team will receive a notification with some feedback on why the application was rejected. When an application is approved, the team will move into the due diligence phase.

### Step 5: Due diligence and KYC/AML requirements { .scroll-element #grantsProcess.phases.step5}

If your team's grant application is accepted and you sign your formal agreement, your team will undergo due diligence, which includes KYC/KYB required information.  This information will be obtained by an independent third party so that we comply with all AML and KYC requirements.   The final agreement will specify the terms of the contract and required milestones to release milestone payments. The agreements are to be signed by all relevant parties.

Once all successful applicants have completed due diligence, the grant committee team will announce that round's grantees. The amount of funding committed in the round will also be disclosed.

### Step 6: Grant progress and Milestone review { .scroll-element #grantsProcess.phases.step6}

During this stage of the process, the grantee would submit milestone/progress reports. These reports will provide insight to the grant committee and the community, about the progress of the individual grant. It will also be used to assess the efficacy and robustness of the ETC grant-making program and process. These reports will be made public, for transparency.

The documentation will depend on whether it is a larger project, that has clear and differentiated milestones, or a smaller project without discrete pieces of work. If it is the latter, then a grant progress report template will be completed mid-way through the grant period, to assess the progress of the project.

### Step 7: Wrap-up and Retrospective { .scroll-element #grantsProcess.phases.step7}

This phase is the final step in the grant-making process and if the project has been successful – will lead to the launch of the final project and/or deliverables – as well as the completion milestone payment. This phase commences with a project retrospective that provides a post-mortem analysis to determine and analyze elements of the project that were successful or unsuccessful.

Project post-mortems are intended to inform process improvements that mitigate future risks and promote iterative best practices. Post-mortems are often considered a key component of, and ongoing precursor to, effective risk management. A grant project post-mortem will be required on all projects, as this will allow the grant team to tweak the process as the program matures.

As this is a new process, it will be regularly evolving to take into account learnings from each round and to integrate feedback from participants and the community. Please keep in mind that the EGD grant committee and grant admin teams are not as well-resourced as many other crypto grant programs. We aim to make the processes as clear and transparent as possible and will adapt as needed.
