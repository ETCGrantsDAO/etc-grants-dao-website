# Overview

## ETC Grants DAO { .scroll-element #overview.etc-grants-dao}

The ETC GRANTS DAO (“EGD”) is a non-profit autonomous organization composed of Ethereum Classic enthusiasts, supporters, and developers, aiming to promote the growth of the ecosystem and long-term development of Ethereum Classic.

### Mission:

Our aim is to unite the ETC community to develop the Ethereum Classic PoW blockchain into the leading global smart-contract-based, public chain with high security, decentralization, immutability, and censorship resistance.

### Landscape: 

With Ethereum's migration to Proof of Stake, ETC remains a PoW chain that is more resistant to censorship and centralization with better security than PoS blockchains. 

### Values:

Proof of Work - EGD upholds the Bitcoin spirit and Proof of Work principles originated by Satoshi Nakamoto. As the infrastructure of the blockchain, the PoW-based Nakamoto Consensus mechanism has significant security, decentralization, and censorship resistance advantages over other consensus mechanisms like PoS.

### Code Is Law:

EGD believes in the principle of Code Is Law. This means that decentralized applications must be unstoppable, uncensorable, and immutable, so the system may be uncompromisable and uncapturable by special interests.

### Transformative Technology:

EGD believes that technology should serve humanity, blockchains should be useful, and a Turing-complete blockchain will benefit humanity. EGD will work with the community to build Ethereum Classic into a more secure world computer for humanity in the web3.0 era.

In July of 2022, Bitmain and Antpool [announced](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/07/26/antpool-supports-ethereum-classic-ecosystem-with-10m-investment/) that they were committing 10 million dollars for funding projects of the Ethereum Classic ecosystem. Half of that amount is being held in Tether (USTD) in a Safe multisig wallet [( 0xA208...E8D6 )](https://app.safe.global/eth:0xA208013A926718B43A6609e29691783833dcE8D6/balances) on the Ethereum mainnet and the other half was used to purchase $ETC in November of 2022, which is being held in a Safe multisig wallet [( 0x3db3...2f82 )](https://multisig.etccooperative.org/app/ETC:0x3db3D728B8783656b83c3cB8eDc1481eC3c62f82/balances) on the Ethereum Classic mainnet.

Additionally, the [ETC Cooperative](https://etccooperative.org/) had 250 thousand dollars [budgeted](https://etccooperative.org/posts/2022-04-12-2021-retrospective-2022-budget-roadmap) for grants during the calendar year 2022 and will be contributing those funds into the EGP program as well.

ETC has the largest market cap for any proof-of-work smart contract platform, but its application ecosystem does not yet reflect that value proposition. It is listed on every major exchange and hundreds of millions of dollars of $ETC are traded daily but there are very few decentralized applications using the platform, only a very small amount of TVL in its Defi ecosystem, and few NFT projects.
